The second (older) is for Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers Version: 2020-09 (4.17.0). It will kinda-sorta work in later releases although it was observed than for instance Version: 2023-03 (4.27.0) start to screw autogenerated makefiles. They have clean as .PHONY default task, they require invoking 'make all' to actually build everything etc.
