# aprs2rrd-se
A piece of software to fetch, parse and store data from APRS weather stations into a RRD &amp; MySQL database and on generated HTML website. Currently software support communication with APRS-IS servers using standard text-based protocol. It support any APRS and CWOP wheather station, until it send measuremenet data in APRS wx frames. The program uses RRD round robin database as a main storage for data gathered from APRS-IS, but an user need to generate target RRD files manually basing individul needs (mostly intervals between wx frames). Optionally storing data in MySQL could be enabled. For further information please refer to documentation and example configuration file which consist comments describing most of options
