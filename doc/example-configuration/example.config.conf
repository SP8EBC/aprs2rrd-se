# from internet or connected TNC, do the rest of processing and then close.

# be enabled automatically. In that situation APRS2RRD will send HTTP request
# to API, get the data, do the rest and exit.

# an APRS-IS server and receive incoming packets in the loop. If the connection
# will stall or it will be explicilty disconnected by a server, APRS2RRD will
# reestablish it. In simmilar way, if KISS serial client is enabled 
# the application will open the port and wait for incoming data. If Davis
# Weatherlink client and/or Holfuy client is enabled along with APRS-IS/serial
# there APIs will be queried just after new data will be received
